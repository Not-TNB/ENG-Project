### What We Think
> _"I like that the book includes historical events and educates us about the tragic events in Auschwitz during WW2 in an interesting and engaging way. Sadly, some of the content was too complicated and boring"_ -Jane

> _"What I like about the book is its detailed settings and its realism, in specific  the events that occurred during the Holocaust. However, it has a tragic ending in contrast to my usual read"_ -Tristan

> _"I love the fact that the book has a lot of themes, revolves around friendship and teaches moral lessons such as self-honesty, and kindness. However, I disliked some of the disturbing and depressing content."_ -Ellen

> _"I think that it is a wonderful book as there are lots of characters each with opposing personalities, but there is some  violent content in it which made me feel uncomfortable while reading."_ -Clara

> _"The best part of the book is its unique plot and use of emotion in describing the horrid living conditions of the Jews under the Nazi reign, which also means that some parts were too complicated to understand without knowledge of WW2"_ -Steve
