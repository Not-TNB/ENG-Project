        During World War II, Bruno and his family left Berlin to take up 
        residence near the concentration camp where his father had just become 
        commandant. Unhappy and lonely, he wanders out behind his house and 
        finds a Jewish boy of his age named Shmuel. There, formed a forbidden 
        friendship between the son of a Nazi commandant and a young Jewish 
        prisoner at Auschwitz, oblivious to the real nature of their surroundings.

      <h1 data-aos="fade-up">What we think</h1>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        "I like that the book includes historical events and educates us
        about how sad the Auschwitz events were in an interesting &
        engaging way, especially the moments where Bruno sneaks out to see
        Shmuel. Unfortunately, that didn't appply to all the events that
        happened in the story as I found some of the content too complicated
        as to boring" -Jane
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        "What i like about the book is that the settings are very 
        detailed and that the story relates to reality, in specific 
        the events that occurred during the Holocaust. What i dont like 
        about the book is that it has a sad ending, in contrast to 
        most other books that i have read." -Tristan
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        "I love the fact that the book has a lot of themes and revolves
        around friendship and we learn a lot of moral lessons such as
        self-honesty, kindness etc. However, I really dislike the 
        parts of the story where it there were disturbing and 
        depressing contents." -Ellen
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">        
        "I think that it is a wonderful book since there are lots of
        characters each with opposing personalities but there are some 
        violent contents in it which made me felt uncomfortable 
        while reading." -Clara
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        "In my opinion, what interests me most about this book is its
        unique storyline and excellent portrayal of the characters' emotions.
        Set during World War II, the book provides an insightful description
        of the living conditions and struggles of Jewish people under the
        Nazi reign, however, there were too many complicated ties to WWII
        that made some parts too complicated to understand." -Steve
