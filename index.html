          finds a Jewish boy of his age named Shmuel. There, formed a forbidden 
          friendship between the son of a Nazi commandant and a young Jewish

        <p>
          "I like that the book includes historical events and
          educates us abouut how sad the Auschwitz events were in
          an interesting way, unfortunately, that didn't appply to
          all the events that happened in the story as some parts
          were quite boring" -Jane <br>
          "What i like about the book is that the settings are very 
          detailed and that the story relates to reality, in specific 
          the events that occurred during the Holocaust. What i dont like 
          about the book is that it has a sad ending, in contrast to 
          most other books that i have read." -Tristan <br>
          "I love the fact that the book has a lot of themes and revolves
          around friendship and we learn a lot of moral lessons such as
          self-honesty, kindness etc. However, I really dislike the 
          parts of the story where it there were disturbing and 
          violent contents." -Ellen <br>
          "I think that it is a wonderful book since there are lots of
          characters each with opposing personalities but there are some 
          violent contents in it which made me felt uncomfortable 
          while reading." -Clara <br>
